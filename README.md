This project is for The Odin Project (TOP) Foundations Course

I will be using HTML to make a site for some of my favorite recipes!

Hopefully, you will see my new skills in HTML text, lists, images, and links.

*This was also kind of a refresher for me on HTML syntax since I've learned a bit of HTML before!
